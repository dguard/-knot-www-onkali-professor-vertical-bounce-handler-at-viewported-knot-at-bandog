* a few days ago i walked at street and largeeeest dog Lord Brin tried to attack my dick
* i saved myself. after such moments you think very very clear
* but even Lord Brin understands that induction is bad, and saves himself too
* but another dog at building further on a street don't understand anything


* at first time i thought that it is a computer voice of a dog. captured to device
* but it is a "real" "concrete" dog


* i slept this week a half of a day, and worked 2 hours cause other time there were dogs and "knocking"


* these dogs don't understand concrete "voice", they understand sounds, "knocking". i think they were grown by blood. harsh dogs' owners
